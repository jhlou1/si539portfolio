      <h2>Hi, I'm Jiahao.</h2>
      <p>I'm currently a master student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor majoring in Information Science with a specialization in user experience design.

        As a designer, I focus on user experience so that I can provide meaningful and relevant experience to users. As Don Norman said that "No product is an island", I believe that creating a usable product isn't enough, designers also need to concentrate on other aspects such as efficiency, pleasure, and fun!

        In my leisure time, I like to hit the gym and to drive around with my friends looking for good food.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My aspirations in the field of information are to design better experience for users and to help more groups to be benefitted from technology. 
        More specifically, I have an interest in accessibility design and inclusive design when it comes to user experience design. My aspirations began 
        when I was part of the accessibility team in a student organization. As I was doing research on accessibility design and inclusive design, I realized 
        that there were many underserved groups, they were not benefitted from the digital tools that we use daily. </p>
      <br>
      <p>One of my experience is that elderly are 
        encountering inconvenience and troubles as many countries are using more digital tools for all kinds of services such as digital payments. Taking China 
        as an example, most of the stores are using either Alipay or WeChat Pay and some of them even refuse to take cash. However, many elderly are not tech-savvy 
        persons and operating these digital tools is definitely a challenge for them. Again, I feel that many groups of people are still underserved as todayâ€™s 
        technology is developing rapidly. Therefore, I have an aspiration in helping more underserved groups through user experience research and design. I believe that 
        exploring more ways of how people and technologies interact and getting to know users with empathy allow us to develop better human-centered solutions.</p>
